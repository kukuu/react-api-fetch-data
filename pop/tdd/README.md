# TDD

RED - Write a test. The test fails because you haven't written any code

GREEN - Write code that passes your test (and all previous tests). Dont be clever, just write code so your tests pass!

REFACTOR - Refactor your code! There are many reasons to refactor, such as efficiency, code style, and readability. Make sure your code still passes your tests as you refactor.
Refactor is done to enhance:
    i.Efficiency
    ii. Readability
    iii. Coding Style

## Run test

1. yarn add add -D jest
2. jest test
